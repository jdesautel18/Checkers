# Meme Checkers (Early WIP)

# What?
An early development checker game with a twist for ipads using python. Developed in the app Pythonista. This game is suppose to be a complete meme. Right now it is only implemented with voice bits from the legend Carl Wheezer.

# Why?
I like Checkers, memes, and I got bored. I am using it as a way to learn iOS GUIs through python.

# Screenshots (Early Dev)
